The player assumes the role of the protagonist participating in the Schwarzwelt research mission. Gameplay consists of a journey through a maze full of traps, and turn-based battles with demons. During battles, a player&#8217;s character may come into contact with demon opponents and, in the course of communication, convince him to join the team.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The creation of the game began with the desire of the development team to create a large-scale role-playing game for the Nintendo DS console. Most of the team has previously worked on the games of the Megami Tensei series, including producer and designer Kazumu Kaneko, director Eiji Isis, screenwriter Shogo Isogai, and composer Shoji Meguro. Antarctica was chosen as the setting for the purpose of focusing the game on the international audience (the previous games of the series take place mainly in Japan). Along with the new setting, the game also contains elements of science fiction, previously less widely encountered in the series, taking inspiration from films such as Cursed Valley and Something. When creating music, Maguro used more grandiose musical styles than in his previous works, including choral music and the use of a special synthesizer. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics, both in Japan and abroad.</div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Gameplay</h2><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Main elements</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a role-playing game in which a player takes control of a character soldier, whose name is entered at the beginning of the game. During the plot scenes and communication with the demons, the player can choose the replicas of the character. If the replicas in the dialogue with the demon affect his mood towards the player&#8217;s team (aggressiveness or desire to join), then the choice of the replica in the storyline can affect the hero&#8217;s worldview (order, neutrality, chaos) and, thereby, bring him closer to a different ending.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Schwarzwelt is explored from the first person: the 3D locations observed from the character's eyes are shown on the upper screen of the Nintendo DS, while the lower one shows a map of the area to simplify navigation. Card fields visited by the player are automatically displayed on the map; for doors, containers and other "special" fields, special symbols are used. "Special" fields include traps, such as pits, dangerous surfaces (causing damage or causing a negative effect), teleportors and vector surfaces that send the player in a certain direction. In addition to the main storyline, there are additional tasks in the game, which are given by people from the research team and some demons who inhabit the Schwarzwelt.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The character of the player around the world observes through a "smart" costume called Demonica, short for DEMOuntable Next Integrated Capability Armor - Removable with integrated armor adaptation. It is this costume, and not the character, that earns experience points by "adapting" to the environment. Depending on the answers to the psychological test at the beginning of the game, the percentage probabilities are set to increase one or another skill at the level. As you gain experience, the suit automatically increases the level and five parameters:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Strength determines the damage from the character's physical and rifle attacks.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Magic increases the hero's magic points and the effectiveness of certain spells.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Dexterity determines the chances for the character to hit / dodge an attack.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Endurance determines the character's health points and, in part, protection.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Luck affects random factors in the positive direction for the character.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">The cash equivalent in the game is Macca. For victories over enemies or investigation of anomalies, the player receives Forma, which are information carriers or "entities" of some creature, object or location (for example, the demon Garuda reserves the feather after the death, the demon, They are a horn; in each the sector has its own specific set of emerging forms, etc.). From Forms and Mackey, Red Sprite ship technical staff is able to create programs for Demonics (important, Main Apps and Sub Apps), which allow you to open new locations, find new enemies and change game variables (the chances of events in battle or during a merger, etc.), weapons (melee and ranged combat), body armor, accessories and various items of consumables, such as first-aid kits.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Melee weapons, which include legendary swords and spears, inflict physical damage on one or several opponents and can also impose one of the negative effects on enemies. Firearms, which are mostly fictional, allow the character to use "infinite" ammunition, inflicting shooting damage, as well as using special projectiles that act like demon spells and consume magic points. Body armor identifies vulnerabilities to certain types of damage and increases the overall protection of the character. Accessories give different bonuses to the parameters or immunity to negative states.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Battle</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">During the research, the player participates in battles, both against plot opponents and bosses, as well as against random standard opponents. The battles are step-by-step and represent a fight between a player&#8217;s character and the demons caused by him through the Demon Summoning Program (up to three) against one to five opponents. One of the features of the combat system is similar to Press Turn, which previously appeared in the previous part of the series, Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne: in Strange Journey it is called the Demon Co-op System. If someone from the player&#8217;s team inflicts critical damage or damage against which the enemy is vulnerable, then all allies of the same worldview simultaneously produce an unblocked, unprotected attack that deals all-powerful damage to the Almightly. In total, the game has nine types of damage:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Physical - the most common type of damage, inflicted basic attacks of most demons. Unlike previous games in the series, where physical attacks spent part of the attacker's life points, in this part basic attacks are made free of charge, and enhanced physical attacks spend magic points, like spells.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Gun - is a subtype of physical damage, inflicted with firearms (available to the player, as well as from human opponents) and some demon spells.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Fire - one of the standard for the Megami Tensei series, and for role-playing games in general, the type of damage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Ice - one of the standard for the Megami Tensei series, and for role-playing games in general, the type of damage.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Electric is one of the standard types for both the Megami Tensei series and role-playing games.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Wind - the only type of damage involved in Strange Journey from the "additional" elemental types found in the Megami Tensei series.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Exile is a formal type of damage that includes spells for instantly killing an enemy. Associated with the light, "good" and angelic beings and demons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Curse - a formal type of damage, which includes spells to instantly kill the enemy. Associated with darkness, "evil" and hellish entities and demons.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Almightly - a type of damage that has no resistance against it, and therefore always inflicted in full.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">Also present are the negative effects of attacks and spells:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Sleep - the effect of temporarily taking the enemy out of battle. A sleeping opponent regains some of his strength each turn. When attacking a sleeper, he cannot dodge and receives increased damage, while the effect of sleep is removed. The game has a spell Eternal Peace, instantly killing all sleeping characters.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Poisoning is an effect that deals damage with each character's action. Independently does not disappear. The effect does not disappear out of combat.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Paralysis is an effect that reduces a character&#8217;s ability to evade and defend, and also with a certain chance of depriving the character of action in a round. Independently does not disappear. The effect does not disappear out of combat.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Silence - the effect that deprives the character of the ability to read spells (shoot special shells in the case of the main character). Independently does not disappear. The effect does not disappear out of combat.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Charm - an effect that causes a character to change sides during a battle and attack former allies. A lonely enchanted character begins to do damage to himself. The effect disappears after a few rounds or at the end of the battle.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Stress is an effect that causes a character to lose points of magic. Independently does not disappear. The effect does not disappear out of combat. Can only be used against player characters.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Fear is an effect that causes a character to sometimes remain inactive in a round. The demons of the player can leave the battlefield by hiding in Demonika. Disappears after a few rounds or at the end of the battle.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">A bomb is a special effect applied only to the player&#8217;s creatures by the opponent. "Mined" character when taking damage can explode with a 50% chance, causing great damage to its allies. Damage depends on the amount of health "mined" at the time of the explosion. The effect is neutralized using the "Protect" command.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Rage is a special effect applied only to the player&#8217;s creatures by the opponent. It is similar to charm, but the furious character gets a bonus to the attack and can attack any random creature on the battlefield, but not himself.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Petrification is a special effect similar to the state of death. However, unlike death, he does not send the demon to Demonics without life points, but forbids him to act, while increasing his protection. The main negative effect is that when a petrification affects a player&#8217;s character, the effect is similar to instant death and stops the game.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Death - the state of the character when he can not perform any game action. The death of the protagonist means the end of the game. The dead demon hides in Demonika and can be resurrected by magic or cured in the Red Sprite infirmary.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Interaction with demons</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">During battles, the player can also start a dialogue with demons: depending on the character of the demon and the player&#8217;s choice of answers to his questions, he can be bribed, scared, hired, furious, seduced, etc. As a result, the demon can join the player , give him a gift in the form of a form or a healing item, leave the battle, become uncommunicative, or even get an additional round of attacks against the player's party. Since a player cannot have more than one demon of each type at a time, negotiations with such a demon become impossible - he &#8220;notices&#8221; the presence of the same demon in the player&#8217;s game and either attacks with anger or leaves the battle, leaving the gift with some chance.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Demons at the player's disposal can be informationally &#8220;crossed&#8221; using the Demon Fusion Program. This allows you to receive previously unknown demons, control the skills they acquire and adjust the team to your taste and requirements. The game includes about 300 demons for hire, all of which are mythological creatures or gods from world religions, including Christianity, Buddhism, and many local and ancient mythologies.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Demons are broken up into "Families" connected mythologically or thematically. Thus, the Divine family contains the first eight orders of angels in Christianity, while the Dragon family includes dragons and characters capable of taking their form. All family members are divided into levels and have the same world view in terms of order / chaos. There are also several special families in the game:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;">Prime - the four spirits of the elements (earth, air, water and fire) and the four elementals of Paracelsus. When merged with another demon, they turn him into another member of his own family. Two Prime unite in Mitama.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Mitama - four personifications of the emotions of the human soul, when merged with another demon, slightly increase its parameters while disappearing. One demon can be enhanced with a mitta only two times.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Enigma - gods whose mythological origin is unknown. To be able to create them, the player must have a converter, received as a reward for the quest &#8220;Scouting in the toilet&#8221;, where the player will have to fight with the Japanese god of toilets and waste places Kanbari.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">UMA, Unidentified Mysterious Animal - creatures, often challenged, as existing in the real world. To be able to create them, the player must have a converter, received as a reward for the quest "Sport for gentlemen", which includes the hunt for the Japanese tanuki madedanuki.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Fiend - creatures that personify death and destruction. These include David (thematically based on Danse Macabre), the &#8220;joking&#8221; character Matador, the demon girl Alice (the allusion character on Alice in Wonderland), the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, a skeletal angel-troubadour (according to Revelation, the seven angels will take turns trumpeting , reporting on the approach of one of the seven gods of God) and the Mother Harlot (sitting on the Beast of the Apocalypse). David, Alice and Mother Harlot are bosses of additional tasks, the others very rarely appear as opponents, each assigned to a sector, starting with Carina. To be able to create them, the player must have a converter, received as a reward for the quest "Catch the Rabbit!", Where the hero must catch the white hare for Alice, and then fight with her.</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Zealot - gods who are outcasts in their own pantheons. They differ in that they can not be created by the player "intentionally", but appear only in the case of "Merger incidents".</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">Each daemon with a specific set of characteristics and abilities can be saved using a 32-digit password. This password contains all the information about this demon and can be used to re-create it when using the previous one in the Merger, or to transfer the password to another player. Although a player&#8217;s character cannot summon demons above his level, passwords for demons specifically designed for one or another plot battle are often found in recommendations for passing and other materials about Strange Journey. Also, there are 3 optionally available demons in the game, obtained only with a password (Ishtar, Alziel and Demon-Hu) and some "demons" based on plot characters used during development.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">All demons are divided according to their worldview: one scale, Light-Neutral-Dark, determines the demon's predisposition to battles - light creatures do not meet in battles against random opponents and can only be created through Mergence; dark creatures, on the contrary, never speak to the player during the battle, almost without the possibility of avoiding the battle for some exceptional cases. The second scale, Law-Neutral-Chaos, is one of the distinguishing features of the series, as it significantly affects the plot and gameplay. From the outlook of this scale depends on the ability of demons to participate in the System of Cooperation of Demons; the effectiveness of certain types of attacks; the ability of the player to use certain weapons or armor; the availability of some quests, and most importantly, the so-called End Game.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">A significant element of the game mechanics are the Phases of the Moon. Their 16, zero phase is considered a new moon, the eighth - the full moon. Phases alternate from zero to eighth and back. Phase is a measure of time in the mechanics of the game, some attacks cause damage depending on the phases (some are most effective in the full moon, some in the new moon), and during the full moon negotiations with demons are impossible, but when you launch SubApp "Lunatic" acquire a random character - during the dialogue, the demon's speech is insane and the player is only required to choose one of two answer options, each of which has a certain chance of a positive reaction from the demon.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">New Game +</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">Formally, the goal of the game is a one-time passage of the storyline. However, in the game there is a system of Achivements, in the game Records, some of which can not be obtained with a single pass. So, there are achievements for getting each of the three endings (for Order, Chaos and Neutral path), opening the entire world map (which is unavailable due to the region hidden during the first passage of the region), as well as for defeating each of the enemies of the Fiend family, whose members have a very small chance of appearing. Also, in one passage it is impossible to obtain information about all 300 demons in the game.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">When you pass the player again, additional SubApps are opened to buy for Macs, which make the game much easier (for example, Red Carpet removes random opponents altogether). The previously closed right side of the dungeon in the Grus sector opens, containing several new enemy demons and Forms for collecting. Also, two additional plot tasks are opened (see Plot &#8212; Schwarzwelt's Father) and a pole-terminal is activated in the Antlia sector, allowing you to re-fight all sector bosses and final bosses defeated in previous iterations, receiving rare items and additional experience points as a reward.</div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Plot</h2><h3 style="text-align: justify;">World and characters</h3><div style="text-align: justify;">The events of this game, as well as many games of the series and spin-offs, take place in one of the alternate realities for the Earth. Somewhere in the first half of the 21st century, a huge atomic explosion of unknown nature occurs in the Antarctic near the South Pole, provoking an anomaly called the Schwarzwelt. The anomaly slowly expands, absorbing the surface of the earth like a black hole. Drones sent inside the Schwarzwelt upon arrival there transmit images of destroyed cities, huge supermarkets and other strange things. The United Nations, which created the Joint Project, finances the creation of an expedition to the Schwarzwelt, equipped with the latest technology and achievements - the goal of which is to research and destroy the anomaly.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The protagonist is one of the Strike Team expedition, serving on the central ship of the expedition, Red Sprite. He is subordinate to Commander Gore, leading the entire expedition and research AI Arthur. Red Sprite is accompanied by similar ships Blue Jet, Elves and Gigantic. An associate American soldier, Jimenez, serves as a liaison for the Blue Jet. A significant place in the study is occupied by the Russian scientist Zelenin, who is on board the Elves and is a member of the Monitor Team. After contacting the Joint Project and entering the Schwarzwelt area of &#8203;&#8203;operation, the ships are defenseless against some of the effects of the anomaly and are separated with disastrous consequences.</div><h3 style="text-align: justify;">Plot</h3><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Schwarzwelt dive</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">After an emergency landing in ice caves, Red Sprite personnel are under attack from an invisible enemy. A data package suddenly comes to the Demons of Militants, which, when unpacked, turns out to be the Demons Challenge Program. Using it, the hero and comrades are able to see, communicate and fight with demons on an equal footing. Having suffered heavy losses, the Red Sprite team settles down the base and proceeds to research the first sector. During the search, the team detects Blue Jet. The main character and Horus arrive to rescue the only surviving crew member, Jimenez. During this mission, a private, but strong enough demon Orias attacks the unit. Gore defeats him, but being distracted by his subordinates, he receives a fatal stab in the back. The hero is forced to fight with Orias himself and kill him. The body of the Mountain is immersed in the Red Sprite, Arthur takes over the leadership of the mission and the staff of Red Sprite, with Jimenez who joined them, proceeds to further study the anomaly.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the course of research, it turns out that for transportation between the Schwarzwelt zones, it is necessary to obtain information objects, Rossette, guarded by powerful demons, rulers of sectors. The lord of the first sector, Moraks, turned part of his possessions into a city destroyed by bombing, a monument to the human love of war and destruction. Going down to the dungeon and defeating the guards in the face of the demons. They, the hero meets Morax face to face and defeats him in a fight, having got the rosette of the sector.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the second sector, the team discovers a huge palace full of rooms with silhouettes of naked girls and torture chambers. The main character, exploring his premises, is captured by the lord of the second sector, the demon-researcher Mithra. During the captivity, the player meets Zelenina, learns about the death of the majority of Elves passengers and the terrible experiments on people conducted by demons. Mithra invites the protagonist to himself and sets him free, expecting from that unauthorized consent to become a test subject. Having organized a massive attack with elements of a distracting maneuver, the protagonist stormed the palace to release Zelenina, but was captured again due to the invisible butler-fomor. After the battle with the zombie partner Norris, the hero and Zelenina escape from captivity thanks to Mastema, the mysterious black-winged angel. Using the gift of Mastema, the protagonist defeats the invisible butler and penetrates deep into the palace. In the study of torture Jimenez finds and arrogates to himself a funny demon Bug-bu. In the end, the main character gets to the hall of Mithras and kills him, taking the rosette of the sector.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The third sector turns out to be a huge supermarket, full of poisoned, inedible or sham food. The lord of the sector is the insatiable Horchos, at the time of the hero's arrival, devouring the remains of Elves with the rest of the crew contained in it. After the development of a special weapon with the help of Mastema, the hero, Jimenez and Zelenina follow Horkos for a long time, provoking him to "spit out" the remains of the ship. The wounded Khorkos is hiding in the &#8220;sanctuary&#8221;, while carelessly dropping the uniform that serves as the basis for the entrance program to the &#8220;sanctuary&#8221;. The hero creates a program, goes deep into the sector and overtakes the villain, destroying him in battle to get a rosette.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the fourth sector, full of debris and waste, the team stumbles upon a "mental parasite" causing uncontrollable bouts of rage. Part of the team interrupts each other until Zelenina and the hero learn from Arthur that there is equipment on the ship to create a cure for such viruses. The protagonist travels to the second sector, where he finds a prototype of the "parasite" in the hidden laboratory of Mithra. Having created a cure for the &#8220;parasite&#8221; and tested it on the thriller Anthony in the infirmary, the hero and Zelenin cure the infected survivors, including Jimenez. The source of this "parasite" is an unknown demon that exists in several places at once. After the destruction of several mirages, the hero meets the real guise of a demon - the lord of the sector Asura, trying to "heal" humanity from the pollution of the world by self-destruction.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">During the healing period, Jimenez Bug-Bu sacrifices his life to protect him. When the demon is resurrected using accumulated data (a function that is also available to the player), Jimenez discovers that Bug-Boo is only three-quarters of a demon &#8212; a quarter he is human. Also during the search for Asura, Horus "comes to life" (his body is under the control of mystical power), escapes from the infirmary and begins periodically to appear in front of the player as he dives into the Schwarzwelt, asking him if he remembers their original purpose of the journey - destruction of the anomaly. The Red Sprite team decides to leave the anomaly as soon as possible.</div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Escape attempt</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">After receiving four rosettes and going with them to the fifth sector, the team contacts the Joint Project and learns from them about the presence of a &#8220;exit&#8221; from the Schwarzwelt scanned outside. The fifth sector turns out to be a labyrinth garden with a lot of teleports and water sources. On positive emotions from the atmosphere of the sector and the early possibility of returning home, the team is looking for a way out when Arthur calls everyone to the base. The reason for the total collection is Lighting - the fifth ship of the Joint Project, the prototype of four ships of the expedition, before which it was sold to a large private businessman, got into the anomaly through the exit indicated earlier. The Lighting team uses more sophisticated equipment, weapons, Demonics, consists of mercenaries and thugs and is aggressive in dealing with demons and, in a neutral way, towards an official expedition. However, despite the cold reception, the Lighting team, led by Captain Jack, is helping Red Sprite to find a way out of Schwarzwelt in exchange for finding rare Form and a copy of the Demons Challenge Program.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Upon finding the exit point, a player led by Jimenez and Zelenina stumbles upon Ouroboros, the dragon goddess who gave birth to the demons of this sector. After two exhausting battles with her (between which the squads of the team are forced to clear the neighborhood of the sector from the demonic defenders of the goddess), the hero manages to defeat and kill the dragon, after which he discovers the mysterious Form - it turns out to be a more complicated rosette for transporting even longer distances inside the anomaly. When trying to escape from the Schwarzwelt using the resulting Form through the exit point, Red Sprite falls into another, sixth sector. The Joint Project, which had been waiting for the research team to leave the anomaly, without warning, began a nuclear bombardment of the Schwarzwelt - due to the fact that the demons began to penetrate the dome and attack South America and Africa. The team is again in crisis.</div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Strange worlds</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">Arthur reports that, similarly to the four lords of the first sectors, there are several mothers of demons, all of whom should be destroyed in order for the Schwarzwelt anomaly to close.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the sixth sector, a labyrinth of yellow and gold walls of a strange design (resembling the movie Tron), the player&#8217;s character meets the masters of the first four sectors, each of which was reborn in a new, more perfect form (for example, Asura is transformed into Ashera). In the interval between battles with masters, the Red Sprite team learns about the creation of its own spatial sector by Captain Jack within the anomaly. Upon arrival there, the team expects a cold reception of mercenaries, security guards with the requirement to get out. Jimenez is called to spy on Lighting, but he is caught. During an operation to save him, during which the creepy experiments of the Lighting team on crossing demons without the Merge Program of Demons, are found, the player is forced to save the lives of Jimenez and Bug-Bu, merging them into one entity with the help of merge equipment. After the death of Captain Jack at the hands of the player and Jimenez the half-demon helping him, former assistant captain Ryan promises to join Red Sprite together with the survivors to kill the mothers.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having dealt with the threat of Lighting and defeating the four reborn masters, the player&#8217;s character descends to the lower level of the sector where Tiamat, the second mother of Schwarzwelt, wins, and takes her Form.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">The seventh sector is the world of illusions. It is full of locations with the design of the first four sectors, which are presented in inverted colors. To penetrate the lower levels of the sector where the third mother, Maya, is hiding, a player needs to go through the sanctuary of demons of chaos that are neutral towards people. Also in the sector is found the sanctuary of angels, controlled by Mastema, one of whom guards the passage to the sanctuary.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">It turns out that Ryan killed the guards from the Red Sprite team and is now going to strike back, once again accumulating combat potential. Seeing no other way to solve the problem, dejected by the battles, Zelenina turns to Mastem. He, with her consent, turns her into an angel and makes it possible to fascinate opponents with her voice. Zelenina clears the brains of Ryan's team, forcing them to serve her, which terrifies Jimenez, who is now reveling in the power of a demon. With the help of Zelenina or Jimenez, the hero opens a seal on the door that hides the passage deep into the sector. After that, Jimenez leaves the crew.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Having passed the maze of traps and teleporters, similar to the fifth sector and including traps from four pey sectors, the player&#8217;s character falls into Maya's lair and kills her, taking the third special Form.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">As you approach your goal, the player discovers that the Schwarzwelt was created by the great goddess mother, Mem Aleph, to destroy humanity for all that it has done to the planet. This Schwarzwelt is not the first and is not the last - the earth has already experienced several such &#8220;restarts&#8221;. Red Sprite arrives in the last, eighth sector, in order to fight with Ma'am Aleph. Commander Gore appears, reborn as a demon-servant of the anomaly, and informs the team about the existence of World Eggs &#8212; artifacts that allow the world to &#8220;restart&#8221; without fully absorbing Schwarzwelt. Depending on the outlook of the hero and his dialogue with Horus, the player chooses the ending path:</div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Path of Order</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">The player unites with Mastema, who is the envoy of the archangels Michael, Raphael and Uriel (meaning that they are hiding under the guise of&nbsp; "Three Wise People" appearing in front of the player at the beginning and in the middle of the game), and Zelenina subordinate to him, who received the title and essence of the angel judge . The player hunts for World Eggs in order to create a world of perfect order, in the course of which he kills Gore, Jimenez and, in order to destroy the restraining force of the anomaly, Mem Aleph. In the new world of order, the song of the angel Zelenina under the control of Mastema makes all beings of the planet who have received immortality not engage in anything but senseless chanting of God.</div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Chaos Way</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">The player decides to assist in the absorption of the earth by the Schwarzwelt anomaly and obeys Mem Aleph along with Jimenez and Lucifer (who appears during the game in the image of the mysterious girl Luisa). The player hunts for World Eggs in order to prevent the use of their Mastema. After the death of "Mountain" and the victory over Mastema himself, the last obstacle in the way of the player becomes Zelenin ascended to God in the form of a silver angel. In the new world of chaos, people and demons fight for existence among themselves and the strongest always win.</div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Neutral Path</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">The player listens to the instructions of the "Mountain" and reminders of the purpose of the expedition, receives information about the method of destruction Schwarzwelt with the help of World Eggs and continues the mission according to the original plan. Both Jimenez and Zelenin stand in the way of the player, and after the death in battles of both, the angry Mastema escapes, and Mem Aleph gives the hero a final battle to prevent the destruction of his Black World. The Schwarzwelt is destroyed, the &#8220;reset&#8221; of the world is canceled, and the hero and the surviving members of the expedition team become spiritual and intellectual prophets, trying to bring about rationality in relation to nature and themselves to the people of the whole world in order to prevent the new Schwarzwelt.</div><h4 style="text-align: justify;">Father Schwarzwelt</h4><div style="text-align: justify;">When you repeat the game in the same New Game + two consecutive additional missions open in the penultimate, seventh sector, which reveal the game's plot even more.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">In the sanctuary of the angels, in front of the door sealed and guarded by the angel-Force, the player encounters not the guardian, but the mysterious man in Demonica asking for help - in the dungeons of the sector parallel to the player previously visited during the storyline, Allat is hiding. After the death of the goddess, it turns out that the mysterious man is the disguised Metatron, to whom the hero just helped to remove the last sealing spells from the prison of the &#8220;father&#8221; Schwarzwelt - Demiurge, one of the incarnations of God who provoked Ma&#8217;am Alef to create the Schwarzwelt with the goal of erasing humanity once and for all from the face of the earth as his unfortunate creation. An unknown female voice asks the player to defeat the demiurge before it is too late, for which he has to find the third, the best version of the program for detecting demons, in the eighth sector and again descend into the same dungeon, where he fought with Allat. After defeating the Demiurge, the hero, depending on his outlook and decision of the player, can either expel the demiurge from this world to his new reincarnation, or subjugate him and accept him as a demon-companion.</div>
